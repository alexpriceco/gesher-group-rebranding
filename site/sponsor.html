	“In my first college class, the professor told us that top firms in business don’t recruit at UCSC and that it was unlikely that any of us would get a first job on par with students from Stanford or Berkeley.”

<div class="body-copy">Gesher Group represents the first real opportunity available for UCSC’s undergraduate students to gain the exposure and network necessary to compete for top jobs after college. By contributing to our organization, you’re helping undergraduate students to stand out and bring in opportunities that seemed out of reach.</div>

<br><br>

<div class="body-copy">Your support goes towards speakers, workshops, and materials to supplement the courses our members take from UCSC. Our annual goal is to fundraise so that our funding also covers operational expenses while leaving capital to dream big for the future.</div>

<h2>Easy to Contribute</h2>
<div class="body-copy">We want to make every Gesher Group sponsorship into a mutually beneficial relationship.

Show your support through PayPal, or by sending a check. If you have questions, we’d love to meet with you in person.</div>
